Jazm√≠n General Approuch to Software:

My 4 principals for have an approuch to code.

A)UX oriented to developer 
B)TESTING --Work for everycase
C)SCALABILITY --Can reuse, and can take this for be part to another estructure
D)SPEED --Can I be this faster?

A) I try to be the most verbose possible in :
My functions and classes and I try to put my code in as a recipe
even dough in the first place that functions and class
dont be the fasterst I belive if I can model my problema in
an organize and understandbly way and everybody can read my approuch it could be
easier make my structure faster. but If I make the opposite as a first approuch 
it could be an ugly experience travel by the code for made this better.

If the most important thing for me, cause its you cozy with the code 
testing, scalability and speed comes in a easier way.


1) Understand the problem.
2) Request information for identify if you actually right or need more details.
3) Model the idea in a hight-level and explain Why do you are taking this decision
4) Begin the code
5) If you take 5 or more debbuging request help
6) When you debbuging explain what do yo doing and Why
7) repeat 6,7 until the finally moment of the test.
8) Request feedback
